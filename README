I. Building the meta-ci20 BSP layer
========================================


In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a
ci20 image by adding the location of the meta-ci20
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  yocto/meta-xxxx \
  yocto/meta-xxxx/meta-ci20 \

To enable the ci20 layer, add the ci20 MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "ci20"

You should then be able to build a ci20 image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a SD card (see instructions on how to do
that below.

# dd if=core-image-sato-ci20-20101207053738.rootfs.sdcard of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M
# sync
# eject /dev/mmcblk0

To update upboot on the mmc card

dd if=spl/u-boot-spl.bin of=/dev/mmcblk0 obs=512 seek=1
dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 obs=1K seek=14
sync
